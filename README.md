# Froggy Crossing the Road

Froggy Crossing the Road is a fun, modern twist on the classic arcade game Frogger from 1981. Inspired by the original, this university project brings back the challenge of guiding a frog across busy roads and tricky rivers to safety.

## Controls

Move the frog using simple keyboard commands:

- Arrow Up: Move forward
- Arrow Left: Move left
- Arrow Right: Move right
- Arrow Down: Move backwards

## How to play

Your mission? Help the family of frogs hop their way to safety by reaching each of the five designated "homes" at the top of the screen. But watch out!

- Getting hit by a car means losing a life.
- Diving into the water costs you a life.
- If you ride a log off the screen, you'll splash into the water and lose a life.

You start with your family having five lives. Lose them all, and it's game over. Can you dodge the dangers and safely guide all frogs home?

## Download Instructions

 - For General Users:
If you're simply looking to play the game, download the "Game" folder. Inside, you'll find an executable (.exe) file along with a necessary .dll file. Simply open the .exe file, and you're ready to start the adventure.

 - For Code Enthusiasts:
For those interested in delving into the game's code, download the "Source Code" folder. The code was written using Notepad++ with the assistance of an ASM plugin. The graphics handling in assembly was achieved using the Canvas framework.
